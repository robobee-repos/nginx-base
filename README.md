# Nginx-Base

## Description

This is a base image for Nginx. It modifies the parent image insofar as the
Nginx serves per default on the ports `8080` and `8433` and is run as a 
non-priveleged user.

Furthermore,
it can take input configuration files to override the image configuration
files, allowing for Kubernetes config maps.

## Environment Parameters

| Variable | Default | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| NGINX_HTTP_PORT | 8080 | Nginx HTTP port number. Overrides the listen directive in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` because the container can not start on port 80. |
| NGINX_HTTPS_PORT | 8443 | Nginx HTTPS port number. |

## Input Configration

| Source | Destination |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| /nginx-in/nginx.conf | /etc/nginx/nginx.conf |
| /nginx-confd-in/*.conf | /etc/nginx/conf.d/ |
